                                            The ideas of textual or data mining (TDM) and subsequent analysis go back
                                            hundreds if not thousands of years. Originally carried out manually, textual
                                            and data analysis has long been a tool which has enabled new insights to be
                                            drawn from text corpora. However, for the potential benefits of TDM to be
                                            unlocked, a number of non-technological barriers need to be overcome. These
                                            include legal uncertainty resulting from complicated copyright, database
                                            rights and licensing, the fact that some publishers are not currently
                                            embracing the opportunities TDM offers the academic community, and a lack of
                                            awareness of TDM among many academics, alongside a skills gap.</p>

                                        <p>The ideas of textual or data analysis go back hundreds if not thousands of
                                            years. Originally carried out manually textual and data analysis has long
                                            been a tool which has enabled new insights to be drawn from text and data
                                            corpora. </p>

                                        <p>The development of the computer enabled the automation of the processes
                                            involved, including information retrieval, searching, indexing, reading and
                                            analysis of literature that exists in a digital format. These automated
                                            processes, often referred to as <a
                                                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining">text and data
                                                mining</a> (TDM), have many everyday uses, including the underlying
                                            technology behind Internet search engines and targeted advertising, a
                                            variety of ways to access library collections, and sentiment. There are many
                                            potential uses for TDM within academia, including within biomedical,
                                            biological and chemical research where genes, species names, chemical
                                            compounds, and statistical significances can all be extracted. Clark (<a
                                                    href="#1">2012</a>) provides a useful introduction to the topic.</p>

                                        <p>Although the computer-based techniques date back to the early 1980s,
                                            unsurprisingly, the development of TDM as a field has relied heavily upon
                                            improvements in computational hardware, including lowered memory and CPU
                                            costs, development of high speed networks, as well as innovations in
                                            software, including natural language processing techniques, and optical
                                            character recognition. </p>

                                        <p>Any content undergoing analysis has to exist in what is termed a 'machine
                                            readable format', one of several formats known as XML or JSON that allow a
                                            computer to read and understand the information contained. PDFs, often the
                                            <i>lingua franca</i> of academic journals, while able to present
                                            standardized formats for humans to read, are not machine readable, and as
                                            such for TDM purposes, this work must be transferred into a different
                                            digital form (Hobbs, <i>et al</i>., <a href="#2">1982</a>). That form is
                                            often custom and specific to the research question being asked and the most
                                            appropriate tools to answer that question. </p>

                                        <p>There is, unsurprisingly, a vast literature describing research into, and
                                            applications of, TDM, as well as the technical challenges. However, to date
                                            relatively little has been written on the political, social and legal
                                            barriers involved. The primary legal issue associated with TDM relates to
                                            copyright, database rights and licensing4, to which there are political
                                            solutions. The lack of awareness, and relative technological gap between
                                            many TDM tools and the skills of many academics also acts as a barrier. </p>

                                        <p>Despite the existence of technological and legal barriers, there has been a
                                            growth in interest in TDM over recent years; including the creation of the
                                            first publicly funded text-mining centre, the <a
                                                    href="http://www.nactem.ac.uk/">National Centre for Text Mining</a>
                                            in Manchester in 2004, TDM being the subject of various reports, including a
                                            2012 JISC report (McDonald and Kelly, <a href="#3">2012</a>) and the
                                            development of <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams">Google Ngram</a>.
                                            This growth in interest is not simply a reflection of the improvements in
                                            techniques and technologies. There has been recognition that TDM
                                            technologies provide broad economic and societal opportunities, including
                                            "increased researcher efficiency; unlocking hidden information and
                                            developing new knowledge; exploring new horizons; improved research and
                                            evidence base; and improving the research process and quality." (McDonald
                                            and Kelly, <a href="#3">2012</a>)</p>

                                        <p>However, for the potential benefits of TDM to be unlocked, a number of non-
                                            technological barriers need to be overcome. These include legal uncertainty
                                            resulting from complicated copyright, database rights and licensing, the
                                            fact that some publishers are not currently embracing the opportunities TDM
                                            offers the academic community, and a lack of awareness and technological
                                            skills among many academics with respect to TDM. These are not the only
                                            barriers to the uptake of TDM; however, topics such as ethical and privacy
                                            issues for medical data, the fact that data quality can be poor, e.g., data
                                            held in different systems, missing, corrupted, non-standardised data; the
                                            fact that sometimes patterns emerge which are in fact due to random
                                            fluctuations; and the fact that setting up a sophisticated TDM facility
                                            involves substantial investment in IT systems, building databanks and
                                            recruiting expertise are not considered further in this paper.</p>

                                        <p>The primary legal issues facing anyone wishing to undertake TDM are copyright
                                            law, database law and contract law (the licensing of work)<span
                                                    style="vertical-align: super;"><a href="#n1">1</a></span>. While the
                                            issues raised below are relevant worldwide, the comments regarding legal
                                            standing below are specific to UK law, and readers should not assume they
                                            are applicable to other jurisdictions. There will however be similarities in
                                            these other jurisdictions. </p>

                                        <p><i>Copyright</i> law, many claim, states that anyone creating and recording
                                            in any manner a new creative work (i.e., one not copied from elsewhere) is
                                            automatically granted copyright protection over that work. This protection
                                            gives the owner the right to authorise, or to refuse to authorise, certain
                                            'restricted acts' by any third party; these acts include copying, adaptation
                                            of the work, redissemination (for instance publishing it on the Web), all,
                                            or a
                                            "substantial part" of the original copyright work, as well as translation of
                                            the work into other languages. </p>

                                        <p>In practice, copyright law is more complex than stated above. Simple facts
                                            (which includes much data) are not subject to copyright, and nor are short
                                            sentences. What is classified as either a fact or a short sentence remains
                                            ambiguous and controversial, and is often only resolved by means of a court
                                            case. A recent European Court case<span style="vertical-align: super;"><a
                                                    href="#n2">2</a></span> confirmed that a sentence of 11 words was
                                            capable of being protected by copyright; though this does not imply that all
                                            similar sentences will be protected by copyright. </p>

                                        <p>As the act of copying is considered to infringe the Intellectual Property
                                            Rights of copyright owners, this leads to some legal ambiguity around the
                                            process of TDM. Some processes of TDM, from a PDF, may require the
                                            production of a temporary interstitial file. Whether those files are "legal"
                                            is focus of debate between those who support or oppose wider TDM use. Is an
                                            interstitial file the equivalent of a temporary file from Adobe Acrobat
                                            Reader? Or is it a derived work and therefore a breach of copyright? </p>

                                        <p>These questions are significant. As the majority of the academic literature
                                            currently exists under copyright, without licenses relinquishing rights, we
                                            can assume much of the literature that would be used for TDM would be under
                                            copyright. While there are some so-called exceptions to copyright<span
                                                    style="vertical-align: super;"><a href="#n3">3</a></span>, which
                                            permit third parties to copy, or carry out restricted acts, without having
                                            to pay or having to request permission and although such exceptions in some
                                            countries such as the United States, are considered sufficient to allow for
                                            content mining, researchers may be reluctant to test the law which is not
                                            well defined for these activities. In the UK, until a recent change to
                                            copyright law, there were numerous copyright exceptions, however the wording
                                            of these were either ambiguous or arguably did not apply to TDM. </p>

                                        <p>This results in a legal barrier, which can prevent risk-averse researchers
                                            (or their institutions) from relying upon copyright exceptions to carry out
                                            their research, and instead approaching publishers (as most of the works
                                            they wanted to use were indeed owned by publishers) for permission to TDM
                                            for a particular project for a particular pre-defined question. Sometimes
                                            this permission would be readily granted at no charge, but many publishers
                                            wanted unreasonably high fees and/or placed such restrictions on what could
                                            be done with their materials and/or took an extremely long time to decide
                                            how to respond, so that in practice the permission was not obtainable. There
                                            are some notable exceptions, such as Springer and The Royal Society, that
                                            have taken a generous approach to granting permissions to researchers to
                                            undertake TDM, but alas they are still a minority. In any case, TDM
                                            researchers have to approach multiple publishers, each of whom have
                                            different attitudes, conditions, and speed of response to such requests.
                                            This is very costly to a researcher, and would have significant impact upon
                                            the take-up of TDM as a practice, or (so anecdotes tell us) inhibit
                                            academics from sharing the outputs of their research using TDM, therefore
                                            limiting the potential benefits this technology enables. </p>

                                        <h3>3. Recent changes to UK law</h3>

                                        <p>In 2010, the UK Prime Minister commissioned a report to consider whether the
                                            UK's intellectual property framework was up to the task of supporting
                                            innovation and growth (the Hargreaves Report) (Hargreaves, <a
                                                    href="#4">2011</a>). One of the key recommendations (Chapter 5.26)
                                            was that the UK government should introduce a copyright exception to allow
                                            the use of analytics for non-commercial use. It is not clear where
                                            Hargreaves developed this idea from, but it must in part have been based on
                                            evidence submitted by the UK library and research communities, e.g. (LACA,
                                            <a href="#5">2011</a>). In December 2012, the UK Intellectual Property
                                            Office carried out an impact assessment for the introduction of such an
                                            "exception for copying of works for use by text and data analytics". For
                                            that purpose, it defined "text and data and data analytics methods" as
                                            methods to: "extract data from existing electronic information, to establish
                                            new facts and relationships, building new scientific findings from prior
                                            research. These new methods involve copying of prior works as part of the
                                            process to extract data" (UK IPO, <a href="#6">2012</a>). It did not attempt
                                            to put a figure on the likely economic impact of such a change to the law,
                                            but noted that in the longer term, the change would lead to "social
                                            innovation and longer term scope for major economic gains." </p>

                                        <p>On the 1 June 2014, the UK Parliament passed legislation to change the law on
                                            TDM, stating that: </p>

                                                this section, would not infringe copyright, that term is unenforceable."
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>The importance of this change to the law cannot be over-emphasised. Firstly,
                                            at a stroke, it puts to an end the arguments about whether TDM might or
                                            might not have been permitted under previous UK copyright exceptions.
                                            Secondly, it makes efforts by publishers to impose their own terms on UK-
                                            based researchers a waste of everyone's time and money. Thirdly, it offers a
                                            role model for other countries for legislation wording to help promote these
                                            useful techniques. Finally, at least temporarily, it offers TDM researchers
                                            in other countries a way to by-pass licensing restrictions and copyright
                                            infringement worries by working collaboratively with UK-based researchers
                                            who have lawful access to the relevant raw materials, letting the UK-based
                                            TDM researcher undertake the work, knowing that there is no legal risk
                                            involved. </p>

                                        <p>It is clear that the numerous constraints have, for UK researchers, been
                                            removed at a stroke. This is not to say that the situation is perfect. There
                                            is still confusion about how widely the term "non-commercial research" might
                                            be interpreted. Clearly a researcher employed by a pharmaceutical company
                                            cannot claim to be doing "non-commercial" research, but what about a
                                            researcher in academia who has received funding from a pharmaceutical
                                            company, or has been seconded to a commercial company to undertake TDM
                                            research? Or an independent researcher who plans to publish their work on a
                                            blog, which gains income from advertising. These questions will only be
                                            answered by Court cases &#151; something that rights-owners and TDM
                                            researchers will each be reluctant to engage in, and until these questions
                                            are resolved, there are many researchers who will remain hesitant to fully
                                            embrace these tools. </p>

                                        <p><i>Database</i> rights are similar to, but more limited than, those for
                                            copyright, and applies to certain collections of data (data including many
                                            entities, such as words, numbers, or images, though probably not to moving
                                            images or sound recordings). The protection of rights in databases is
                                            complex, and a simplified summary only is given here. A database can enjoy
                                            copyright (and be subject to the points above about copyright law) if the
                                            selection and arrangement of the materials in the database has involved
                                            intellectual effort. In other words, a collection of data can be protected
                                            by copyright if there is sufficient creativity involved in the presentation
                                            or arrangement of the set, although the underlying individual data points
                                            remain free of any protection. </p>

                                        <p>Thus, a totally comprehensive database of records, where no selection has
                                            been undertaken, cannot enjoy copyright. But if there has been intellectual
                                            effort in making the selection, then copyright applies. In addition, and
                                            quite separately, a database can enjoy database right if effort of any kind
                                            has been expended in obtaining, verifying and presenting the data. </p>

                                        <p>A database, therefore, might enjoy copyright and/or database right, or it
                                            might have no rights at all associated with it, dependent on how the
                                            database was created in the first place. As with copyright, the law here is
                                            often unclear and acts as a chilling effect and barrier to many. </p>

                                        <p><i>Licences/contracts</i> are important features of the TDM legal landscape.
                                            Owners of copyright and/or database rights will often grant permission to
                                            third parties to read, download, redisseminate or otherwise exploit their
                                            materials, typically for a fee (which can be substantial in the case of
                                            large scholarly publishers owning a wide range of resources). Such licences
                                            will inevitably impose terms and conditions &#151; limitations &#151; on
                                            what the licensee can do with the licensed materials. Increasingly, we are
                                            seeing an uptake in Creative Commons licences, which enable authors grant
                                            blanket permissions to third parties to use their work in pre-defined
                                            manners. However even these relatively liberal licenses impose some terms
                                            and conditions on the user, such as having to acknowledge the source<span
                                                    style="vertical-align: super;"><a href="#n4">4</a></span>. Many
                                            non-Creative Commons licences do not allow TDM (although these licences are
                                            of course over-ridden by copyright exceptions within a specific country such
                                            as the UK, or Japan, which has a similar exception to the UK for TDM). </p>

                                        <p>While some public funders, such as the UK Research Councils now require the
                                            use of Creative Commons (CC) licences for research outputs produced by their
                                            funds, many research funders around the world have not yet done the same.
                                            The use of these licences can be very useful for academics who wish to
                                            engage in TDM in those countries without appropriate copyright exceptions.
                                            Machine-readability of licences is crucial for TDM, although many publishers
                                            have yet to exploit fully the opportunities that the machine-readable CC
                                            licenses offer. Furthermore, licence proliferation should be resisted,
                                            especially in instances where the new licences produced are not
                                            interoperable with those already existing. This is especially important in
                                            an international context, given ambiguities in interpreting copyright law
                                            within different jurisdictions. With Creative Commons licences, the <i>de
                                                facto</i> standard in Open Access licensing, and increasingly within
                                            open data, one has question why publishers feel the requirement to try to
                                            impose control in this fashion, and why many of these licences are framed as
                                            'Open Access', despite not conforming to the <a
                                                    href="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">BOAI
                                                definition of Open Access</a>. </p>

                                        <p>A recent example of licence proliferation can be seen from The International
                                            Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers who recently
                                            promoted their own set of licences (STM, <a href="#7">2014</a>). An
                                            introduction to these licences states, without any supporting evidence, "the
                                            complexity of stakeholder interests and commitments means that no one
                                            solution that is imposed externally can be effective, whether by way of
                                            national exceptions or otherwise: solutions must therefore be worked out by
                                            multi-stakeholder dialogues which respect stakeholders' interests, are
                                            conducted in a transparent manner and aim at models that are simple and
                                            scalable." Such publisher-driven TDM licences have been the subject of
                                            fierce, and justified criticism by the library (LIBER News, <a href="#8">2014</a>)
                                            and researcher communities because the proposed licences are too limiting
                                            and impose unfair (and in the case of the UK, unenforceable) constraints on
                                            researchers' freedom to exploit TDM. </p>

                                        <h3>4. What can politicians and policy makers do? </h3>

                                        <p>In many countries, the law relating to TDM is ambiguous, and this will
                                            inhibit researchers from undertaking it. Copyright and database rights
                                            should evolve to reflect practices and technologies of the time, not inhibit
                                            the development of new research. Where ambiguities lie, these should be
                                            removed. For instance, under current EU law, countries in the European Union
                                            are able to introduce exceptions for non-commercial TDM research, but to
                                            date it is only the United Kingdom which has taken advantage of this. There
                                            has been no change to date at the EC level, although they are considering an
                                            EU-wide exception for TDM, and the Republic of Ireland is also considering
                                            such a change to its law. Outside of Europe, the authors have only heard of
                                            one or two other Far East countries that have introduced such exceptions.
                                            This is a significant barrier to TDM worldwide. </p>

                                        <p>While it is clear that the UK is leading the way here, there is nonetheless,
                                            ambiguity remains regarding what is, or is not, "commercial research", and
                                            it may well require some court cases to clarify the situation, although the
                                            ambiguity is likely to have a chilling effect until these questions are
                                            resolved. Research funders can encourage the use of Creative Commons
                                            licences for research outputs resulting from their funding, and are in a
                                            position to engage with their fundees about the problems facing licence
                                            proliferation. </p>

                                        <h3>5. Publishers are not embracing opportunities of TDM</h3>

                                        <p>It is clear that some publishers are very reluctant to give up the control
                                            they currently have over how TDM is carried out on materials where they own
                                            the copyright. A typical statement comes from Richard Mollett, the head of
                                            the UK Publishers Association: "we support content mining. It can only work
                                            well if we are involved in the process and managing the access." <span
                                                    style="vertical-align: super;"><a href="#n5">5</a></span> The
                                            guidance to the legislation introduced in response to the Hargreaves
                                            legislation specifically states that publishers can <b>only</b> apply
                                            'technological measures on networks that are required in order to maintain
                                            security or stability but won't be able to enforce contract terms that seek
                                            to prevent or unreasonably restrict text and data mining", and it will be
                                            interesting to see if publishers recognise that, e.g., <b>requiring</b> a
                                            TDM researcher to use only its "approved" API is not lawful. </p>

                                        <p>Publishers can do much to help TDM researchers. Given the recent changes to

                                            publishers can help TDM research by dropping efforts to "control" the

                                        <p>It is no secret that commercial scholarly publishers do not enjoy a good
                                            reputation with scholarly researchers at the moment. This has been caused by
                                            cynical policies on Open Access (with publishers sometimes using the term
                                            when what is on offer is not OA at all), and so-called "double-dipping"
                                            charging for gold and subscription-based journals. The recent change in UK
                                            law gives publishers a golden opportunity to improve their reputation. But
                                            will they grasp it? </p>

                                        <h3>7. Awareness among academics and a technological gap </h3>

                                        <p>It appears to the authors that there is a lack of awareness among many
                                            academics regarding TDM technologies, what these technologies may enable,
                                            and how to use the technologies. Current TDM researchers are very
                                            technologically adept and work will need to be done to develop the existing
                                            tools to be easier for utilisation by those with less expertise.
                                            While The Content Mine is beginning to redress some of this, developing
                                            training workshops on TDM, and other organisations such as Software
                                            Carpentry are running workshops to help academics become more technically
                                            confident, much more needs to be done. Some of this will need to come from
                                            the wider TDM community, who need to help close the gaps in knowledge,
                                            ability and awareness, but funders and institutions also have a
                                            responsibility to help ensure academics are trained on such skills and
                                            technologies; by running workshops, incorporating training sessions into PhD
                                            skill sessions, and by production of information for academics to read and
                                            understand. </p>

                                        <h3>8. Conclusion</h3>

                                        <p>The main barriers against the uptake of TDM are not technical, but primarily
                                            a lack of awareness among academics, and a skills gap. They relate to legal
                                            issues around copyright and database rights, and to some policy choices of
                                            restrictions being implemented by publishers on (for instance) access to
                                            APIs. These problems are all soluble, but require non-technical
                                            solutions. </p>

                                        <p>Within the UK there are now copyright exceptions for TDM. Other countries
                                            should look to implement similar, perhaps using wording from UK legislation
                                            as a template, making it clear that TDM is permissible within their
                                            jurisdiction. Publishers should work with the TDM academic community to
                                            develop agreed statements as to what types of research they agree is "non-
                                            commercial" and which is "commercial", and prevent any possible chilling
                                            effect from ambiguity around these terms. Funders and institutions should be
                                            exploring how to teach TDM techniques to interested academics, including the
                                            possibility of opportunities to learn about it within PhD programmes.
                                            Within the UK, we have got about as far as politics can take us. What we now
                                            need to do is to show the value of TDM, to encourage other countries to
                                            develop similar copyright exceptions, and to show other academics that TDM
                                            is worth their time. </p>
